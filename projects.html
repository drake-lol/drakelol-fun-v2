            these are all of the projects that i am (or have) worked on. there is not much here right now but it is here if you would like to see them

            <h1>github</h1>
            my github page is <a href="https://github.com/drake-lol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> if you want to look at any of the source code for this website or most of my other projects.

            <h1>reverb vr</h1>
            this is my vr game that i have recently started work on. it is not even close to done and it is more of a learning experience because i want to learn a new language and i thought making a game in unity would be the perfect way to learn how to code in C#.
            <br> the link to the github source can be found <a href="https://github.com/drake-lol/reverb-vr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>more coming soon</h1>
            there will definitely be more projects coming soon, of course, this is just all that i am working on at the moment. big things are coming soon so be sure to look back every now and then.
